                In a city with one of the highest crime rates in the word, an
                ordinary man is walking down the street. Now this street isn't
                anything special. A lamp post here, a trash bin there, the
                occasional barking dog, but on this night, it was quieter than
                usual. With almost no traffic and only one other person walking
                down the same street. Now where was this ordinary man headed? To
                the store maybe, although most of them would be closed down this
                late at night. Or maybe to his home to sleep after a long day of
                work at his ordinary job. I guess that's not too important now
                is it. The man wasn't really going to make it there anyway. As
                the man stopped to check his watch. The figure, who had now
                gotten closer than most people would be comfortable with, had
                passed by the man. The man crumples to the ground, a knife in
                his chest, and he lies there silent and still until someone
                happens to walk by the body and call the police."
